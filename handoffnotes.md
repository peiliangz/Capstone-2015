# Handoff Notes:

Hello all,

In this email we have attached a zipped folder, within this zip file there is all of our code, our final project writeup and these notes written within `handoffnotes.md`. The complete documentation can be found within `documentation.md`, all the code can also be found on the Github repository located here: https://github.com/peiliangz/Capstone-2015/. 

The live website is still located here: http://peiliangz.github.io/Capstone-2015/

We suggest that you follow the steps below so that the website can be hosted on the HADatAc repository (this makes it simpler for people to recognize the project since it is hosted on the same repository, and offers you the ability to control the website better). 

## To Add the Website to the Current HADatAc Repository on Github:

Create a new branch, on the repository that you want the website hosted on, titled `gh-pages`. Commit all the files from the zipped files attached within the email or by cloning the current repository we are using [here](https://github.com/peiliangz/Capstone-2015). Once you commit the files you should be able to go to *username*.github.io/*repo-name*. Where you should see the website up and running.
