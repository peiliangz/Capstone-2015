# Handoff Notes:

Hello all,

In this email we have attached a zipped folder, within this zip file there is all of our code, our final project writeup and these notes written within `handoffnotes.md`. 

## To Add the Website to the Current HADatAc Repository on Github:

Create a new branch, on the repository that you want the website hosted on, titled `gh-pages`. Commit all the files from the zipped files attached within the email or by cloning the current repository we are using [here](https://github.com/peiliangz/Capstone-2015). Once you commit the files you should be able to go to *username*.github.io/*repo-name*. Where you should see the website up and running.

If you have any questions about how to make any edits or any other general questions please feel free to reply to the first email.
