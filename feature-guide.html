                                <h4>On the HADatAc use of URIs</h4>
                                <h5>Static metadata URIs</h5>
                                <h6><u>For Classes</u></h6>
                                <p>
                                    Static metadata classes are intended to be reused across multiple projects, and shared through HADataC.org.
                                     It is possible for one project to have its own set of classes without sharing the classes outside the project.
                                      If that is the case, it is up to the project to define its own policy on how to assign URIs to classes of
                                      static metadata.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     If the project shares classes, we recommend the project to consider the use of the <a class="link" href="http://hadatac.org">hadatac.org</a>
                                      as the base for shared resources. <mark>To request a hadatac.org uri, please contact the email list</mark>
                                </p>
                                <h6><u>For Instances</u></h6>
                                <p>
                                    Static metadata instances are intended to be privately shared within projects. For instance, the serial number
                                     of instruments are not something that is of interest to other projects. Every HADatAc installation has a host
                                      URI, e.g., <a class="link" href="http://example.org">http://example.org</a>. The URI of a HADataC installation is typically
                                       the host URI followed with /hadatac/ (trailing slash is needed),
                                       e.g., <a class="link" href="http://example.org/hadatac/">http://example.org/hadatac/</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    URIs of instances are often stored in a folder within the host machine, which is associated with a given
                                    URL in case the project decides to share their instances. For instance, we can create a folder meta
                                     (<a class="link" href="http://example.org/meta/">http://example.org/meta/</a>).
                                </p>
                                <h5>Dynamic metadata URIs</h5>
                                <p>
                                    URI generators is a piece of software responsible for generating dynamic metadata such as deployments, data collections and datasets.
                                    They are called URI generators because they are also responsible for generating and assigning URIs for dynamic metadata as they are created.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Every HADatac installation has one console, which includes a Deployment Management module. The console's Deployment Management is a URI generator.
                                    MOCCASN, the Android application used for capturing contextual knowledge about human interventions is another URI generator.
                                    The console's Deployment Management module is already pre-registered with HADataC, and its URI generator ID is '00000001'.
                                    All other URI generators need to be registered with a HADataC installation, which will assign a new ID for each registered URI generator.
                                </p>

                                    The Metadata Browser allows you to examine the parts of your data collection that give it context, including the entities observed,
                                     the characteristics being measured, and the sensors taking the measurements.
                                     Metadata is kept as linked data in order to preserve the relationships between it and the data, and leverages ontologies already
                                     in use by other scentific communities to aid interoperability. Ontologies also provide a hierarchical structure of concepts, which
                                      can help lend insight into the organization of the sensor network collecting the data.

                                     You can reach the Metadata Browser from the HADataC portal page by clicking "Browse Metadata", or, if you are already on another
                                      page, by clicking "Metadata Browser" in the black top bar. <mark>Refer to the image of the index HADatAc page above.</mark>

                                 <p>
                                     These three displays show the models of sensors in your data collection project. They are represented as a hierarchy backed
                                     by the HASNetO and VSTOI ontologies. Sensor models are considered classes - that is, they are general concepts rather than
                                     physical objects. The default "tree view" on these pages displays this hierarchy as an interactive tree, with broader
                                     concepts on the left side, branching out into more specific ones towards the right. Click nodes to expand or contract subtrees
                                     (all are expanded by default), or mouse over a node for additional information.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     The "table view" contains the same information as a flat table. Click the name of the model to expand its block entry in
                                     order to see detailed information about that sensor model. The table views all have printer-friendly versions available -
                                     while you are on the table view tab, you can print from your browser in order to get a paper copy of the list with all

                                <p>
                                    These displays are for viewing individual sensors. Each one is an instance of a model, which is why you may see some names repeated
                                    in the table list. For example, your project may use two thermometers of the same model; HASNetO requires that each one have its own
                                    unique identifier (typically a serial number), but because they are both the same class (eg, model), they still share certain
                                    characteristics such as manufacturer or design specifications.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While the Model Hierarchy view gives information about the properties common to all individual sensors of that model, the individual
                                    Lists views shows properties specific to each single sensor. There is only a table view for these displays, and each entry can be
                                    expanded to see detailed information about that sensor. Each table can also be printed out with all entries expanded, if you require
                                    a paper copy for evaluation purposes.

                                <p>
                                    These displays show metadata for what your collection measures. These sections leverage the Extensible Observation Ontology
                                    (OBOE) to describe the Entity and Characteristic of the measurements in order to provide context for the data. In the OBOE
                                    model, the Entity is the thing being observed (such as the water in a lake, the air in a room, or a sample in a laboratory),
                                    and the Characteristic is the specific thing being measured (such as dissolved oxygen saturation, relative humidity, or color).
                                    Note that it is possible for a sensor to also be an Entity if it also logs data about itself, such as battery charge. Both Entities
                                    and Characteristics are more general concepts, and there is no one-to-one mapping between Entities and Characteristics in OBOE:
                                    two Entities may share a Characteristic (ie, water temperature and air temperature), and a single Entity may have multiple
                                    Characteristics (ie, temperature, relative humidity, and particulate matter are all possible Characteristics of air).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Entity and Characteristic displays also contain both a tree view showing the hierarchy from the OBOE ontology, including
                                    whatever extensions have been made to include concepts relevant to your data collections. As with the sensors' tree views,
                                    subtrees can be expanded/contracted by clicking on the nodes, and mousing over displays additional information in a panel
                                    on the right side.
                                </p>
                                <h6>EntityCharacteristic</h6>
                                <p>
                                    An EntityCharacteristic is, as the name suggests, a pairing of an Entity with a Characteristic. These are the more specific
                                    things that we can match to Detectors as "sensing perspectives". If a thermometer only works in water, then it has "WaterTemperature"
                                    as the EntityCharacteristic of its Sensing Perspective. This differentiates it from a different thermometer that only works in air -
                                    both measure the same Characteristic, but of different Entities. A thermometer that can be used for both AirTemperature and
                                    WaterTemperature has two Sensing Perspectives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The EntityCharacteristic view is a pair of tables that shows the matchings between Entity and Characteristic.
                                    The information in both tables is the same, but displayed differently: one with the Entity in the leftmost column,
                                    and one with the Characteristic in the leftmost column. Both are provided so that you can decide which is easier
                                    to use for your specific task. In both tables, you may sort any column alphabetically by clicking the column name.
                                </p>
                                <h5><u>Standards</u></h5>
                                <p>
                                    The OBOE-Standards ontology provides URI's for units to describe your measurements. The base ontology includes both
                                    SI units and Imperial units, but may require extensions in order to fully cover all units your data collections
                                    require. The structure of the ontology separates units into BaseUnits, which cannot be "naturally decomposed into
                                    other units" (eg, second, or degree Celsius); DerivedUnits, which "raise a base unit to an integer power other
                                    than 0 or 1" (eg, meter-squared); and CompositeUnits, which are composed of one or more base or composite units
                                    (eg, meter-per-second). The tree hierarchy here can be helpful to determine how to classify units you are adding.

                                <h5><u>Agents</u></h5>
                                <p>
                                    Agents include both individuals and organizations related to your data collection project. This naturally
                                    includes people involved in the data collection itself, as well as any organizations/labs/groups with which
                                    they may be affiliated. The Agent network also includes the companies who manufacture the sensors that your
                                    project uses - this helps HADataC store information about their contact information, in case reaching a
                                    manufacturer is necessary to answer questions, and also helps keep documentation resources published by
                                    that company close at hand.
                                </p>

                                    Each node is either a person or an organization, and are connected to other organization nodes to
                                    represent a part-of relationship. For example, a professor's person node will be connected to their
                                    affiliated lab or department's organization node; this is then connected to a node for the university,
                                    which may also have other labs/departments branching off of it, as well.

                                <h5>What are Static Metadata Spreadsheets?</h5>
                                <p>They are spreadsheets used by domain experts to document data-related <a href="#dm">static metadata</a>. Like any other spreadsheet, Static Metadata Spreadsheets
                                    are composed of one or more sheets. Once spreadsheets are filled out completely, they can be parsed, and if they are syntactically correct,
                                    they can be added into HADatAc's knowledge base.
                                </p>
                                <h5>How Do I Build a Static Metadata Spreadsheet?</h5>
                                <p>Static Metadata Spreadsheets are expected to be developed from spreadsheet templates. In a template we have the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>one of more sheets</li>
                                    <li>each sheet has a name (a simple string)</li>
                                    <li>each sheet has just one title row, and nothing else</li>
                                    <li>the title row is composed of two or more columns, each column containing a label</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Once you go through the process of reading the template of a static metadata spreadsheet, you may start the process of describing
                                    your static metadata by filling out static metadata spreadsheets, one row a time.</p>
                                <p>These are some of the rules that you most follow:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Do not add or remove columns</li>
                                    <li>It is okay to group create a spreadsheet that is about a single concept or instance. It is also okay to build a single spreadsheet for all concepts</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h5>Where Can I Find the Static Metadata Spreadsheet Templates?</h5>
                                <p>Use the templates below to create metadata for your scientific activities. A single static spreadsheet template may be used to record needed basic metadata.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a class="link" href="https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/blob/master/public/example/metadata/templates/HASNetO-Template-Full.xlsx?raw=true">Full Spreadsheet Template</a></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Alternatively, the three complementary spreadsheets listed below may be used to record needed metadata. It is recommended that the these spreadsheets are used
                                    and populated into HADataC following the order in the list below.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a class="link" href="https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/blob/master/public/example/metadata/templates/HASNetO-Template-Agents.xlsx?raw=true">Agent Spreadsheet Template</a>
                                        - Used to create agents (including users) and organizations (see example Agent spreadsheet)</li>
                                    <li><a class="link" href="https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/blob/master/public/example/metadata/templates/HASNetO-Template-Classes.xlsx?raw=true">Classes Spreadsheet Template</a>
                                        - Used to specialize classes of the family of Human-Aware Science Ontologies (see example Class spreadsheet)</li>
                                    <li><a class="link" href="https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/blob/master/public/example/metadata/templates/HASNetO-Template-Instances.xlsx?raw=true">Instances Spreadsheet Template</a>
                                        - Used to create instances of registered classes (see example Instance spreadsheet)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5>Which Kind of Content Am I Expected to See Inside of Each Sheet?</h5>
                                <p>Each sheet is either a concept kind (or class) or a list of concept instances. For instance, the sheet named InstrumentModels list the models of the instruments in a sensor network.
                                    The sheet named Instruments lists the actual instruments in the sensor network. The sheets are named according to the concepts described in the following paper (the reading of the
                                    paper is strongly suggested):</p>

                                <h5>What is the Meaning of the hasURI Column At the Beginning of Each Sheet?</h5>
                                <p>Every concept and instance in a sensor network should have a name, and the name of concepts and instances are URIs (unified resource identifiers).
                                    The first column is named hasURI and contains the URI of the concept or instance described in the row of the sheet. If the sheet contains concepts,
                                    the first column identifies the URI of each concept that is going to be registered in HADatAc. If the sheet contains instances, the first column
                                    identifies the URI of each actual instances registered in HADatAc.</p>
                                <h5>How Do I Know if a Sheet is Used to Describe Concepts or Instances?</h5>
                                <p>The header of the second column tells you if a sheet is about concepts or instances. If the sheet is about classes the header is <strong>rdf:subClassOf</strong>. If the sheet is about instances the header is <strong>a</strong>.</p>
                                <p>If a sheet is about a concept, the concept is from the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNetO), which is available at <a class="link" href="http://hadatac.org/ont/hasneto/">http://hadatac.org/hasneto/</a>.</p>
                                <p>These are the URIs of some core concepts</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Platform Model</li>
                                    <li>Instrument Model</li>
                                    <li>Detector Model</li>
                                    <li>Entity</li>
                                    <li>Characteristic</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5>How Can I See the Hierarchies of Core HADatAc Concepts?</h5>
                                <p>To be implemented at a later date.</p>
                                <h5>How Can I Add A New Concept Under an Existing Subconcept?</h5>
                                <p>When browsing an hierarchy, you can inspect the concepts inside the hierarchy but hovering the mouse over the concepts.
                                    The info box on the right side of the browser would show you the details of the concept currently selected.
                                    One of the properties shown in the info box is the URI of the concept. If this is the concept that is going to be the
                                    parent of a new concept to be included, this is the URI that should be added to the <strong>rdfs:subClassOf</strong>
                                    property of the new concept.</p>
                                <h5>What Are the Values that I Should Use in Each Cell of a Row?</h5>
                                <p>Values should be literals or URIs. For example, the second column is always a URI.</p>
                                <p>Each concept is a subconcept of something else. For instance, an instrument called <i>Mass Spectrometer</i>
                                    is a subclass of <i>Spectrometer</i>. Thus, the value of the <strong>rdf:subClassOf</strong> column for the Mass Spectrometer
                                    should be the URI of the spectrometer. In that way, concepts are organized into hierarchies.</p>
                                <p>In the case of instances, each instance should have the URI of a concept. For instance, the value of the a column of a
                                    mass spectrometer should have the URI of the concept <i>Mass Spectrometer</i>.</p>
                                <h5>What are the Values for the Rest of the Columns in a Sheet?</h5>
                                <p>The names are often self-explanatory. The <strong>rdfs:label</strong> is an important exception to this rule is that property
                                    names are self-explanatory. For instance, <strong>rdfs:label</strong> is a textual description of the concept or instance
                                    being described in the spreadsheet.</p>
                                <h5>Can I Validate My Spreadsheet?</h5>
                                <p>A spreadsheet validation consists of a two phases:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The Parsing phase identifies syntax erros during the process of filling out the spreadsheets.
                                        The instructions for <a class="link" href="#psms">parsing static metadata spreadsheets</a> describe how to identify syntax erros and fix them.</li>
                                    <li>The Verification phase executes a number of basic rules to assure a minimal level of quality for the metadata
                                        captured through the use of static metadata spreadsheets. For instance, it is in the verification phase that we
                                        check if every instance has a concept URI, and if the concept URI exists.</li>
                                </ol>
