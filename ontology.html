                                <p>Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNetO) is
								    a comprehensive alignment and integration of well-established
                                    ontologies for encoding scientic sensing infrastructures, scientic
                                    observations, and provenance. The integrated ontology is available at

	                            <p>HASNetO aims to provide the concepts and vocabularies needed to encode empirical
	                                 data's metadata. It is built on top of three ontologies that were integrated and
	                                 extended under the single name of HASNetO: The Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE),
									 the Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO), and the World Wide
									 Web's Provenance Ontology (PROV-O).

                           <p> An object that keeps the instrument in a specic location to
                               ensure that it is recording data about the selected location. A platform may
                               also provide overhead services, such as providing power to the instrument
                               and a data connection. Sometimes a platform is mobile like a plane or a
                               person, or stationary like a tower of a weather station.
                           </p>

                           <p> An object that receives sensed signals from detectors and
                               processes these signals into numerical values. For example, consider a tipping
                               bucket rain gauge. Inside the tipping bucket rain gauge is a magnet-based
                               detector that detects when the bucket tips. However, in order for this signal
                               to be meaningful, the detector needs a bucket with a known diameter, a
                               funnel to direct water into the bucket, etc. Together, these make up the instrument.
                           </p>

                           <p> An object that it is capable of sensing environmental properties
                               by collecting physical signals about these properties, translating these
                               physical signals into (most often electrical) signals, and forwarding these
                               electrical signals to instruments. Transducer is another name for detector.
                               Detector metadata are collected because detectors may be interchangeable,
                               that is they can be removed from one instrument and plugged into another.
                           </p>

                           <p> An activity of physically deploying an instrument and
                               its attached detectors to a platform. This activity indicates that a single
                               instrument is ready to start collecting data.

                           <p>An assertion that a characteristic of an entity was measured
                                and/or recorded. A measurement is also composed of a value, a
                                measurement standard, and a precision (associated with the measured value).
                                Measurements also encapsulate characteristics that were recorded, but that
                                were not necessarily measured in a physical sense. For example, the name of
                                a location and a taxon can be captured through measurements.
                            </p>

                            <p>Defines a reference for comparing or naming entities via a measurement. A standard can be
                                defined intentionally (e.g., as in the case of units) or extensionally (by listing the values
                                of the standard, e.g., for color this might be red, blue, yellow, etc).
                            </p>

                            <p>Defines the technical activity of the collection of data
                                that is empirically observed. So far, the state of the art of semantics for
                                observations and measurements characterizes this activity as an Observation.
                                The HASNetO ontologies take the position that the concept of Observation
                                is a scientic activity while most if not all existing ontologies embody the
                                position that describe the technical activity of data collection.

                                other entities that may be ascribed responsibility. When an agent has some
                                responsibility for an activity, PROV says the agent was associated with the

                                 In HASNetO terms, we see that some prov:Activity instances in

                                 is a human or a machine.

                                prov:Entity is used to specify any information that is fed into an platform,
                                instrument or detector that change the behavior of any of these measuring
                                devices. Finally, while an instance of prov:Entity may be an instance of
                                oboe:Entity and vice-versa, we prefer to treat them separate considering
                                their distinct roles in scientic activities.
